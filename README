Building GRAL from source code
==============================
The source package contains all files necessary to build GRAL from scratch using
the `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__ software project management and
comprehension tool. Like ``Makefile`` files the ``pom.xml`` files are used by
Maven to execute certain steps for generating various distribution or
documentation files.

Building a JAR file of the library core
---------------------------------------
In case you just want to build the core of the library to get started execute
the following command in the ``gral-core`` directory::

  $ mvn install

This will generate a JAR archive named ``gral-core`` in the ``target`` directory.
This JAR file can be added to the class path of your application.

Building a JAR file of the examples
-----------------------------------
In case you just want to build the core of the library to get started execute
the following command in the ``gral-examples`` directory::

  $ mvn install

This will generate a JAR archive for the examples in the ``target`` directory
which can be used together with the library core to run example applications.

Building the distribution archives
----------------------------------
In order to build package archives like the ones available for download you have
to execute the following command in the package directory::

  $ mvn clean package assembly:assembly

This will create a target directory containing the following files::

- ``GRAL-<version>-bin.tar.bz2``
- ``GRAL-<version>-bin.zip``
- ``GRAL-<version>-src.tar.bz2``
- ``GRAL-<version>-src.zip``

Building the documentation
--------------------------
The GRAL Maven project offers two sources for documentation:

1. The standard Maven site containing a project overview and various information
   like the JavaDocs, test results, etc. To build the HTML Maven site in the
   ``target/site`` directory just execute::

     $ mvn site

2. A book-like documentation in the reStructuredText format is available in the
   file ``documentation_en.rst``.

Using GRAL in an IDE
====================
The Maven project can also be used in your favorite development environment like
Eclipse or NetBeans. For further information look at the following descriptions
on the Maven website:

- `Maven Eclipse integration <http://maven.apache.org/netbeans-module.html>`__
- `Maven NetBeans integration <http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html>`__

Once you have installed an appropriate Maven plug-in for your IDE you will be
able to import the GRAL project found in this folder.
