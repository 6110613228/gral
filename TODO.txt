Version 0.7
===========

- Use Drawable for plot area in XYPlot (and BarPlot)

- Add support for axis labels to AbstractAxisRenderer2D;
  Example: you could add text like "x axis" or "temperature [K]"

- Add legend to charts

- Refactor renderers in XYPlot: add setting for default LineRenderer and
  ShapeRenderer to XYPlot

- Add support for variable intersection of axes

- Fix bug that prevents last grid line and axis tick from being drawn.

- Improve line gaps around shapes (currently constant width):
  Use GeometryUtils.grow()

- Add more JavaDocs and unit tests

Version 0.8
===========

- Extend statistics (e.g. arbitrary quantiles, etc.)

- Add support for custom tick labels to AbstractAxisRenderer2D;
  Example: ["-1.0", "-0.5", "Break Even", "0.5", "1.0"]

- Add support for error bars ShapeRenderer

- Add new chart for drawing a pair of rows as line segments;
  Extension of scatter plot possible (Connect every nth pair)

- Allow axes to be rescaled on Chart/window resizing
  Example: Axis is scaled from -3 to +3 -> chart is resized -> 
  new scale for Axis: -4 to +4

- Setting to keep aspect ratio when resizing a chart
  (take alignment into account)

- Set font sizes relative to the size of a standard font size 
  (like "em" in HTML)

- Add support for DiscreteLineRenderer2D to start steps in y-direction

- Add export support to bitmap (PNG, GIF, JFIF/JPEG) as well as vector
  (SVG, EPS) file formats

Version 0.9
===========

- Add more plot types: multiple axis plots, circular plots,
  contour plots, etc.

- JDBC interface to DataSource

- Add JTable that acts as a renderer for DataTable

- Property window to change the charts while the program is running

- Add support for regressions with basic equations
  (linear, exponential, polynomial, etc.)

Version 1.0
===========

- Add 3D support using OpenGL/JOGL (also 2D with JOGL?)
