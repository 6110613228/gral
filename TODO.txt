Version 0.8
===========

- Rename "shape" to "point" (e.g. ShapeRenderer becomes PointRenderer)?

- Add option for automatic selection of tick spacing

- Add category support to axis (instead of ticks)

- Add a PlotPanel class which provides pre-defined context menus and
  other interactive features

- Add support for displaying point value to ShapeRenderer
  Example: BarPlot displaying value for each bar

- Add support for error bars to ShapeRenderer

- Add new chart for drawing a pair of rows as line segments;
  Extension of scatter plot possible (Connect every nth pair)

- Allow axes to be rescaled on Chart/window resizing.
  For example: Axis is scaled from -3 to +3 and chart is resized
  -> new scale for Axis is set to -4 to +4 to keep aspect scale

- Setting to keep aspect ratio of plot bounds when resizing
  (take alignment into account: left, center, bottom, etc.)

- Set font sizes relative to the size of a standard font size 
  (like "em" in HTML)

- Add more possibilities to style plot area (rounded edges, etc.)
  How to do drop shadows? -> Renderer for plot area?

- General review of current API, package structure, and tests;
  Definition of use-cases?

  contour plots, etc.

- JDBC interface to DataSource

- Property window to change the charts while the program is running

- Add support for regressions with basic equations
  (linear, exponential, polynomial, etc.)
