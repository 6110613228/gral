Version 0.8
===========

- Add option for automatic selection of tick spacing

- Add category support to axis (instead of ticks)

- Add support for stroking the edges of points/bars/pie arcs

- Add support for error bars to ShapeRenderer

- Add new chart for drawing a pair of rows as line segments;
  Extension of scatter plot possible (Connect every nth pair)

- Setting to keep aspect ratio of plot bounds when resizing
  (take alignment into account: left, center, bottom, etc.)

- Set font sizes relative to the size of a standard font size 
  (like "em" in HTML)

- Allow axes to be rescaled on Chart/window resizing.
  For example: Axis is scaled from -3 to +3 and chart is resized
  -> new scale for Axis is set to -4 to +4 to keep aspect scale
  Solution: Extract exchangeable layout class from PlotArea
  This would allow an implementation of other layouts, too
  (e.g. median absolute slope [see Cleveland et al. 1988])

- Add more possibilities to style plot area (rounded edges, etc.)
  How to do drop shadows? -> Renderer for plot area?
  
Version 0.9
===========

- General review of current API, package structure, and tests;
  Definition of use-cases?

- Add more plot types: multiple axis plots, circular plots,
  contour plots, etc.

- JDBC interface to DataSource

- Add JTable that acts as a renderer for DataTable

- Property window to change the charts while the program is running

- Add support for regressions with basic equations
  (linear, exponential, polynomial, etc.)

Version 1.0
===========

- API improvements based on review in version 0.9

- Bug fixing

- Cleanup/Optimization

- Examples

- Code Formatting

Future
======

- Implement a more complex application as testing environment
  (like Origin, SPSS, etc.)
